That's the Way of the World, Earth Wind and Fire

Hearts of fire creates love desire
Take you high and higher to the world you belong
Hearts of fire creates love desire
High and higher to your place on the throne
We come together on this special day
Sing our message loud and clear
Looking back, we've touched on sorrowful days
Future pass, they disappear
You will find peace of mind
If you look way down in your heart and soul
Don't hesitate 'cause the world seems cold
Stay young at heart, 'cause you're never, never old
That's the way of the world
Plant your flower and you grow a pearl
