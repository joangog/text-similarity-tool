Wait, Earth Wind and Fire

I've been waiting so long,
Just watching the phone, for you.
To wait, it takes, 
Love that's for real
And all, that I feel, inside to do.
I come prepared, to look in your eyes
And walk side by side,
With you--baby, baby.
Listen for tender words, I'd like to say
Like I love you today, and I'll wait
For you.
It's crazy, if you think, we're just friends.
Loving when, infatuation ends.
The wait for you, baby it now begins.
You sigh, when I come close to your heart.
You cry, from the start,
Please wait for me.
Your mind, shows, places you go,
And things you don't know.
Someday you'll grow.
Climbing a mountain high,
Your love I desire.
Inside my heart cries for you.
It's crazy, if you think, we're just friends.
Loving when, infatuation ends.
The wait for you, baby it now begins.
Baby, we're more, than friends
I know, the wait will end
