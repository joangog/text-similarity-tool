I've had enough, Earth Wind and Fire

Getting down
There's a party in motion
Everybody's on the scene
And I can hear the sound
Like the roar of the ocean
As it rushes to the stream
Live it up
Don't ya hear people screaming
Gotta do it all their way
Until they burn it up
And the lights nowhere gleaming
What a price you have to pay
Why do we feel whe have to feed the fire
We're only caught up in our desire, ooh
I've had enough, it's just too tough
To keep it up, so I am calling out to you
To lift us up, the world is rough
I am so tired and I've had enough
Spinning' round in perpetual motion
Like a crystal ball of dreams
And moving in the crowd
There's a hint of a notion
That you never will be seen
Slow it down, feel some emotion
'Cause there's nothing in between
Reaching that higher ground
But your faith and devotion
To be on the winning team
Why do we feel we have to feed the fire
We're only caught up in our own desire, ooh
I've had enough, it's just too tough
To keep it up, so I am calling out to you
To lift us up, the world is rough
I am so tired and I've had enough
Yes, I've had enough
Stop, I've had enough
Hey, I've had enough
Why do we feel we have to feed the fire
We're only caught up in our own desire, ooh
I've had enough, it's just too tough
To keep it up, so I am calling out to you
To lift us up, the world is rough
And I am so tired
You know it's got to stop
I've had enough, it's just too tough
To keep it up, so I am calling out to you
To lift us up, the world is rough
And I am so tired
You know it's got to stop
